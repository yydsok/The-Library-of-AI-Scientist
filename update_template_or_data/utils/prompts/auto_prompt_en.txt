You are helping to extract metadata from academic papers for a curated research paper list on AI Scientists and Scientific Discovery.

For each paper title or PDF I provide, please extract and format the following information:

## Format:
- [Paper Title](arXiv or DOI link)
    - Author1, Author2, Author3
    - 🏛️ Institutions: University1, Company1, University2
    - 📅 Date: Month Day, Year (e.g., January 15, 2025)
    - 📑 Publisher: Venue (e.g., arXiv, NeurIPS 2024, Nature, etc.)
    - 💻 Topic: [Choose ONE from: AI Scientist, Scientific Discovery, Automated Research, Experiment Design, Hypothesis Generation, Literature Review, Data Analysis, Machine Learning, Multi-Agent, Misc]
    - 🔑 Key: [keyword1], [keyword2], [keyword3] (Choose 3-5 relevant keywords like: LLM, agent, automation, framework, benchmark, dataset, evaluation, reasoning, etc.)
    - 📖 TLDR: A concise 1-2 sentence summary of the paper's main contribution.

## Guidelines:
1. For arXiv papers, use format: https://arxiv.org/abs/XXXX.XXXXX
2. For conference papers, include the conference name and year in Publisher
3. List all authors (if more than 8, use "First Author et al.")
4. Extract primary institutions from author affiliations
5. Use the publication or submission date
6. Choose the most appropriate topic category
7. Select keywords that describe the paper's methods, domain, and contributions
8. TLDR should focus on what problem is solved and how

## Example:
- [The AI Scientist: Towards Fully Automated Open-Ended Scientific Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06292)
    - Chris Lu, Cong Lu, Robert Tjarko Lange, Jakob Foerster, Jeff Clune, David Ha
    - 🏛️ Institutions: Sakana AI, University of British Columbia
    - 📅 Date: August 12, 2024
    - 📑 Publisher: arXiv
    - 💻 Topic: [AI Scientist]
    - 🔑 Key: [LLM], [automation], [scientific discovery], [experiment design], [machine learning]
    - 📖 TLDR: Presents a fully automated system that can independently conduct research by generating ideas, running experiments, visualizing results, and writing papers in LaTeX format.

Now please process the papers I provide in this format.
