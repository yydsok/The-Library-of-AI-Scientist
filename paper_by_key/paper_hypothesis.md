- [DeepScientist: Advancing Frontier-Pushing Scientific Findings Progressively](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26603)
    - Yixuan Weng, Minjun Zhu, Qiujie Xie, Qiyao Sun, Zhen Lin, Sifan Liu, Yue Zhang
    - 🏛️ Institutions: INSTITUTIONS_NEEDED (check paper for affiliations)
    - 📅 Date: September 30, 2025
    - 📑 Publisher: arXiv
    - 💻 Topic: [AI Scientist]
    - 🔑 Key: [automation], [framework], [benchmark], [discovery], [hypothesis]
    - 📖 TLDR: While previous AI Scientist systems can generate novel findings, they often lack the focus to produce scientifically valuable contributions that address pressing human-defined challenges. We introduce DeepScientist, a system designed to overcome this by conducting goal-oriented, fully autonomous sci

- [The More You Automate, the Less You See: Hidden Pitfalls of AI Scientist Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08713)
    - Ziming Luo, Atoosa Kasirzadeh, Nihar B. Shah
    - 🏛️ Institutions: INSTITUTIONS_NEEDED (check paper for affiliations)
    - 📅 Date: September 10, 2025
    - 📑 Publisher: arXiv
    - 💻 Topic: [AI Scientist]
    - 🔑 Key: [automation], [framework], [benchmark], [discovery], [hypothesis]
    - 📖 TLDR: AI scientist systems, capable of autonomously executing the full research workflow from hypothesis generation and experimentation to paper writing, hold significant potential for accelerating scientific discovery. However, the internal workflow of these systems have not been closely examined.

- [MOOSE-Chem2: Exploring LLM Limits in Fine-Grained Scientific Hypothesis Discovery via Hierarchical Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19209)
    - Zonglin Yang, Wanhao Liu, Ben Gao, Yujie Liu, Wei Li, Tong Xie, Lidong Bing, Wanli Ouyang, et al.

    - 💻 Topic: [Hypothesis Generation]
    - 🔑 Key: [llm], [automation], [benchmark], [discovery], [hypothesis]
    - 📖 TLDR: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in automating scientific hypothesis generation, yet existing approaches primarily yield coarse-grained hypotheses lacking critical methodological and experimental details. We introduce and formally define the new task of fine-grained scientific hypothe

- [InternAgent: When Agent Becomes the Scientist -- Building Closed-Loop System from Hypothesis to Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16938)

    - 💻 Topic: [Multi-Agent]
    - 🔑 Key: [agent], [automation], [framework], [hypothesis], [multi-agent]
    - 📖 TLDR: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is accelerating the transformation of scientific research paradigms, not only enhancing research efficiency but also driving innovation. We introduce InternAgent, a unified closed-loop multi-agent framework to conduct Autonomous Scientific Research (ASR) across various s

- [Robin: A multi-agent system for automating scientific discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13400)
    - Ali Essam Ghareeb, Benjamin Chang, Ludovico Mitchener, Angela Yiu, Caralyn J. Szostkiewicz, Jon M. Laurent, Muhammed T. Razzak, Andrew D. White, et al.

    - 📅 Date: May 19, 2025
    - 📑 Publisher: arXiv
    - 💻 Topic: [Hypothesis Generation]
    - 🔑 Key: [agent], [automation], [framework], [discovery], [hypothesis]
    - 📖 TLDR: Scientific discovery is driven by the iterative process of background research, hypothesis generation, experimentation, and data analysis. Despite recent advancements in applying artificial intelligence to scientific discovery, no system has yet automated all of these stages in a single workflow.
